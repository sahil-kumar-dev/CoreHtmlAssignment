        <dd>
            React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs).
            Developed by Facebook, it allows developers to create reusable UI components.
            React uses a virtual DOM for efficient updates and is popular for building single-page applications (SPAs).

            <h4>EXPRESS JS</h4>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
            It simplifies building web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features and middleware.
            Express.js is often used in conjunction with Node.js to create server-side applications.

        <dd>
            MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON.
            It is known for its scalability, flexibility, and ability to handle large volumes of unstructured or
            semi-structured data.
            MongoDB is commonly used in web applications to store and retrieve data.

            <h4>NODE JS</h4>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side.
            It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine and provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
            Node.js is widely used for building scalable and real-time web applications and APIs.

        <dd>
            Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for building web interfaces.
            It provides a set of pre-designed, low-level utility classes that can be applied directly to HTML elements.
            Developers can use these classes to rapidly create responsive and customizable user interfaces.
            Tailwind CSS encourages a highly configurable and component-based approach to web design.
